A dataset included demographic information such as volunteer ID (to maintain anonymity), ethnicity, gender, age, location, bellybutton type, and washing frequency of participants. This data was used to create three interactive graphs. 

The first graph is a horizontal bar graph of the top ten bacterial species found in the bellybutton. This way we can identify which volunteers bellybutton bacteria can be used to manufacture synthetic beef.

The second graph is a bubble graph where the type of bacteria is graphed against the number present. 

Finally the third graph, a gauge graph was created that charted the washing frequency of the volunteers. With the use of Bootstrap, fonts and colors were changed for the resulting page. Overall this is an interactive web page where the volunteer ids are selected and the corresponding graphs change.
